# liri-node-app

The liri-node-app allows a user to search via the command line for artists and bands through the BandsInTown API, for songs via the Spotify API, and for movies via the OMDB API*. All the user has to do is enter a name or title of what they are looking for, and the results will be returned in an easy-to-read format.

*Currently the movie-this command is the only of the four commands which is operational. There is also a link in the repo to a video demo of this application: "Application Demo."
